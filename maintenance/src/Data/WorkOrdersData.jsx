    description:
      "The driving roller drum on the intake 1 elevator head had a worn out rubber surface that resulted in the slipping of the bucket elevator belt. The roller drum was removed and was sent for vulcanizing to restore the rubber surface and improve grip. The roller drum was later reinstalled and the bucket elevator was alligned, tensioned, and tested to ensure proper operation.",
